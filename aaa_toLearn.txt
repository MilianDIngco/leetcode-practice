Routine
1) >= 1 FAANG/Grind75 problem per day
2) try it
3) If I don't know how to solve it, look at solutions
4) type out the solution later in the day
5) add to spreadsheet
6) watch youtube tutorials of the solution

To learn
if input array is sorted
- binary search
- two pointers

if given a tree
- BFS
- DFS

if asked for all permutations/subsets
- backtracking

if given a linked list
- two pointers

if recursion is banned
- stack

if asked for max/min subarray/subset/options
- dynamic programming

if asked for top/least K items
- heap

if asked for common strings
- map
- tree

if need to keep count of distinct elements
- map
- set
else
- map/set for O(1) time & O(n) space
- sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
